## ProfileManipulation

Demonstration of basic options for manipulating Profiles.

### Description

This sample shows a set of basic profile manipulation functions. For example:

- Concatenate
- Mirror
- Rotate
- Translate
- Add Noise
- Clamp
  
### How to Run

This sample may currently be outdated.
Editing the UI might not work properly in the latest version of SICK AppStudio. Use SICK AppStudio version <= 2.4.2 to edit the UI.

Starting this sample is possible either by running the App (F5) or debugging (F7+F10). Setting breakpoint on the first row inside the 'main'
function allows debugging step-by-step after 'Engine.OnStarted' event.
Results can be seen in the 2D viewer on the web-page. Restarting the Sample may be necessary to show the profiles after loading the web-page.
To run this sample a device with SICK Algorithm API and AppEngine >= V2.5.0 is required. For example InspectorP or SIM4000 with latest firmware. Alternatively the Emulator on AppStudio 2.3 or higher can be used.
